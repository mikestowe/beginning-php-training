 - The **Model** represents the data in your application.
 - The **View**  is the visual component that presents the interface for users to interact with that data, such as clickable links, form fields, and buttons.
 - The **Controller** is the coordinator. When users browse to a specific page in our website, the controller is responsible for coordinating what specific actions need to be performed, in order to return a response for that user request.
